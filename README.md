A Password Strength Checker built with JavaScript is a tool designed to evaluate the strength of user-provided passwords in real-time. Here's an overview of its key features, components, and functionality:

Key Features
Real-time Feedback: As the user types a password, the tool immediately assesses its strength and provides feedback.

Strength Criteria: It typically evaluates passwords based on several criteria:

Length (e.g., minimum of 8 characters)
Use of uppercase and lowercase letters
Inclusion of numbers
Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
Avoiding common passwords or patterns
Visual Indicators: The checker can provide visual feedback, such as color-coded indicators (red, yellow, green) to represent the strength level (weak, moderate, strong).

User Guidelines: It may offer suggestions for creating stronger passwords based on the analysis.

Components
HTML Structure: A simple form with an input field for the password and an area to display strength feedback.

CSS Styling: Basic styles to enhance the user interface, making it visually appealing and easy to use.

JavaScript Logic:

Event Listeners: To capture input events on the password field.
Validation Functions: Functions that check each strength criterion and calculate the overall strength score.
Display Functions: Functions to update the UI with strength feedback and suggestions.
